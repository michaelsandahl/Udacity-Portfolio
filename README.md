# Udacity-Portfolio
This was the Portfolio project for the Udacity Front End Web Developer course.

## About
Given a [design mockup](https://github.com/michaelsandahl/Udacity-Portfolio/blob/master/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf) of a portfolio site, I then had to create that site as close as possible. I chose to use the [Bootstrap Framework](http://getbootstrap.com/) as a basis for my site. Initially I have not added any personal styling to the portfolio, choosing instead to try to adhere to the design mockup. As this goes on I may make some changes to the layout, and/or color scheme of the site.
